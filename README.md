About Dataset:
A new benchmark collection for sentence-based image description and search, consisting of 8,000 images that are each paired with five
different captions which provide clear descriptions of the salient entities and events. â€¦ The images were chosen from six different Flickr 
groups, and tend not to contain any well-known people or locations, but were manually selected to depict a variety of scenes and situations.
